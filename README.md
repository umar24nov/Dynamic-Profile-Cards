# Click Mate

### Click Mate is a fun and interactive JavaScript project that simulates adding and removing friends dynamically using DOM manipulation. It features a profile card interface that updates in real-time as users "add" or "remove" friends, showcasing different names, relationships, and profile pictures in a stack-like structure.
